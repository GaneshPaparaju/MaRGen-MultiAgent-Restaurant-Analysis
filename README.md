# 🍽️ MaRGen-Inspired Multi-Agent Restaurant Market Analysis

A **MaRGen-inspired multi-agent system** that performs **automated market research and sales optimization** for restaurant businesses using collaborative LLM agents.

This system demonstrates how **multiple specialized AI agents** work together like a consulting team — retrieving data, analyzing trends, writing insights, and refining recommendations — with **minimal human input**.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Traditional market research is **slow, expensive, and requires human analysts**.

Inspired by the **MaRGen (2025)** research paper from Amazon Science, this project aims to:

✅ Automate end-to-end data analysis workflows  
✅ Generate professional market insight reports  
✅ Provide actionable strategy recommendations for sales optimization  
✅ Reduce time and cost of market research from days to minutes

## 🧠 System Architecture
```
User Query (Business Problem)
         ↓
[Retriever Agent] → Retrieves relevant records from Yelp & Menu Sales datasets
         ↓
[Researcher Agent] → Analyzes data to extract insights (revenue, top items, trends)
         ↓
[Writer Agent] → Creates consulting-style business report with recommendations
         ↓
[Reviewer Agent] → Polishes clarity, flow, and adds strategic recommendations
         ↓
[Streamlit UI] → Displays insights, reports step-by-step
```

## 📊 Dataset

The demo uses restaurant business and menu sales data:
```
data/
├── Hybrid_Yelp_Restaurant_Sales.csv  # Restaurant ratings, reviews, locations
└── Menu_Sales_Data.csv               # Menu items, revenue, categories, dates
```

**Dataset Statistics:**
- **3,600 Yelp reviews** across 15 restaurants
- **3,120 menu transactions** with sales data
- Multiple cuisine categories and price points

---

## 🚀 Running the Demo

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Install Ollama & Pull Model
```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
ollama pull llama3.1
```

### 3️⃣ Launch the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🔬 Inspired by MaRGen Research

This implementation is based on the **MaRGen (Market Report Generator)** research paper that demonstrates:
- Multi-agent collaboration for market research
- Iterative quality improvement (reaching 10/10 scores in 3-4 rounds)
- LLM-as-judge evaluation correlating with human experts (r=0.6, p<0.01)
- Cost-effective analysis (~$1 per 6-page report, ~7 minutes)
